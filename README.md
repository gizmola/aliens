Enhanced Alien Invasion

This is an improved version of the Alien Invasion game from the book "Python Crash Course" 3rd Edition by Eric Matthes, and published by No Starch Press.

The development of the Alien Invasion game is covered in chapters 12,13 & 14

The code in this project is based on the book, but was written as I worked through the chapters.  There are numerous small changes I made to suit my preference or fix small bugs.  It was not based on the author's git repository, other than as the source of the original ship and alien images.

Enhancements
This version has a number of enhancements that you might find interesting.

A background image was added
The original ship and alien bmp images were reworked to have transparent backgrounds
A 2nd alien image was created to facilitate animation
Sprite animation was created for the alien
A google font was loaded rather than depending on the Pygame system font
When the ship fires missiles (bullets) there's a sound effect
